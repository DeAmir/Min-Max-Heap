# Max-Min-Heap
A python implementation of max-min heap.\
A max-min heap is an almost complete binary tree, which each node at even depth is bigger than (or equal to) every children of it, and each node at odd depth is lower than (or equal to) every children of it.


The user can choose to load values from a file of his choosing (pass a filename as a command line argument), to build the heap from. Alternively, he could choose to give the values in the console.
After the heap is built, these operation on the heap are free to run: extract min/max, insert new node, delete a node (by index), heap sort items in heap, print the heap, build a new one, and exit the program.

Built for python 3 and above. Input/output examples, complexity analysis & explaination of the functions that manage the heap are given in the two word documents (in Hebrew).
