# Max-Min-Heap
This project is a part of an assignment in the course Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures as part in my B.Sc in the Open University of Israel.

A python implementation of max-min heap.\
A [max-min](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min-max_heap) heap is an almost complete binary tree, in which each node at even depth is bigger than (or equal to) every children of his, and each node at odd depth is lower than (or equal to) every children of it.


The user can choose to load values from a file of his choosing (pass a filename as a command line argument), to build the heap from. Alternively, he could choose to give the values in the console by hand.
After the heap is built, these operation on the heap are available to run: extract min/max value, insert new node, delete a node (by index), (heap) sort items in the heap, print the heap, build a new one, and exit the program.

Built for python 3 and above. Input/output examples are contained in the Wword document.
